# Copilot demo

This is a demo of how GitHub Copilot can work.

## Markdown-demo

Open ['Markdown-demo.md'](markdown-demo.py) for some example prompts for generating text on-the-fly.

Try:

- Write a sentence or two from a story. Then see if CoPilot suggests a continuation. Accept the suggestion with `tab`.
- Prompt CoPilot to translate it to other languages.

## Python-demo

Open ['python-demo.ipynb'](python-demo.ipynb) for some example prompts to build `python`  programs.

- Examples that previously worked:
  - Create a normal distribution and plot it.
  - Create a simple data set for doing a linear regression, fit a model, and plot it.
  - Create a simple data set for doing a logistic regression, fit a model, and plot it.
    - For any of the above, prompt CoPilot to do the same using plotly.
  - Create a dataset for doing a decision tree, fit a model, then plot the decision tree
  - Create a complex plane and plot it in 3D using plotly
  - Create a map of Södertälje, Sweden using folium
  - Scrape yahoo finance to get AstraZeneca stock data and plot it
